IMPOSSIBLE TIC TAC TOE V1
by Pat Dayton

Areas for Further Improvement:

I understand how to do these things but the time commitment to fix them would be large. Diminishing returns and all.

1)Clean up algorithm. 

Lot's of ugliness going on behind the scenes there, especially within the fork and block fork functionality. However, it does, at the moment seem to be unbeatable which was the goal. 

2) Mobile responsiveness

It get's pretty ugly when you close browser size down

3)Back buttons on initial menus.
